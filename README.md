It's my project for learning english words.    
For this I used React and TypeScript.    
Node is used as a server. Similarly, all data is stored in Node in JSON.    
In the near future the data will be stored in the database.  

In the project directory remember, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.  
  
In the project directory rememberBack-end, you can run:
### `nodemon index.js`
Runs server Node.js
[http://localhost:3001]
